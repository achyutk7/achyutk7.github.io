      <p>Over the summer of 2020, I worked with a COVID-19 Modeling Consortium based in Austin, TX that was working with the
          local government officials to help curb the spread of COVID-19. There was a limited number of hospital beds and they
          were filling up fast. The city of Austin wanted to know what policies they should enforce to ensure that we do not reach
          capacity and have to enter another lockdown phase. </p>

      </div>

      <p>Within the Consortium, I worked with other Northwestern researchers where we used stochastic optimization on a SEIR model in combination
         with different policy decisions to determine what was the best set of policies to enact when. The data that we used was the hospitalization
         records provided to us by the city of Austin. We applied the model on the data and projected the path of COVID-19 cases given various policy
         decisions that ran until the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>Using this model, we were able to help flatten the level of COVID-19 cases in Austin right before it reached lockdown level!</p>
