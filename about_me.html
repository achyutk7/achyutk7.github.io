        <p>My name is Achyut Kasi. I study Industrial Engineering and Computer Science at Northwestern University.
        I lived in New Jersey for almost my entire life, although I was born in Fremont, California. Growing up, my favorite hobbies
      were playing video games and mixed martial arts. I loved learning as much as I could about astronomy. I was fascinated by what was out there
      to explore and how vast the universe was.</p>
        <p>Going into high school, I learned more about myself and what my passions were. One of them was ultimate frisbee. In my freshman year, one of my
            friends randomly stopped by and told me to swing over to frisbee practice after school. Me not knowing anything about the sport at the time, I
            said "Sure, why not?" This was the decision that changed the rest of my life. I quickly fell in love with the sport, albeit I had a very rocky
            start and took years to get the basics down solid. </p>
        <p>Even in college, ultimate frisbee is still a large part of my life as I play for the Northwestern ultimate Team here. However, I also realized
            my passion to give back to society through a club on campus here called Kellogg GRC (Global Research and Consulting). Working with many NGOs
            has been a blast and I love working with clients that promote growth in the society.</p>
